As we have to pay rather high tuition fees, our idea is to make some money with stocks. We want to download some data for interesting companies that are listed at the NYSE and examine risks and returns!

# Data Cleansing and Descriptive Statistics

But in order to download the financial data, we first have to consider the mapping of company names to stock symbols. 


```{r load_nyse_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
nyse <- read_csv(here::here("data_efficient_frontier","nyse.csv"))
```


Now that we have this data, let's have a quick look at the number of companies per sector.


```{r companies_per_sector}

companies_by_sector <- nyse %>%
  group_by(sector) %>%
  count() %>% # count the number of companies by sector
  arrange(desc(n))

companies_by_sector %>% 
  rename(`number of companies` = n) %>% # rename for better reading
  kbl() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")) # have a nice HTML table


ggplot(companies_by_sector, aes(x = n, y = reorder(sector, n)))+
  geom_col() + 
  labs(title = "Number of NYSE companies per sector",
       x = "number of companies",
       y = "sector")

```

Next, let's choose some stocks and their ticker symbols and download some data. Note that `SPY` is the SP500 ETF (Exchange Traded Fund).


```{r get_price_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

myStocks <- c("AXP","BLK","KO","FDX","MCD","ORCL","SPY" ) %>%
  tq_get(get  = "stock.prices",
         from = "2011-01-01",
         to   = "2020-08-31") %>%
  group_by(symbol) 

glimpse(myStocks) # examine the structure of the resulting data frame

```

Financial performance analysis depends on returns. Hence, we first want to calculate daily and monthly returns (given the adjusted closing prices). 


```{r calculate_returns, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
#calculate daily returns
myStocks_returns_daily <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "daily", 
               type       = "log",
               col_rename = "daily_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))  

#calculate monthly  returns
myStocks_returns_monthly <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "monthly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "monthly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col)) 

#calculate yearly returns
myStocks_returns_annual <- myStocks %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "yearly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "yearly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))
```


To get a feeling for the numbers, let's summarise monthly returns for each of the stocks and the `SPY` ETF:

```{r summarise_monthly_returns}

myStocks_returns_monthly_summary <- myStocks_returns_monthly %>% 
  group_by(symbol) %>% 
  summarise(min = min(monthly_returns), 
            median = median(monthly_returns), 
            max = max(monthly_returns), 
            mean = mean(monthly_returns), 
            sd = sd(monthly_returns)) # calculate summary statistics for monthly returns by stock

myStocks_returns_monthly_summary %>% 
  kbl() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")) # have a nice HTML table

```

# Visualizing Data


To get an even better feeling, let's also visualise the distribution of monthly returns for each of the stocks:

```{r density_monthly_returns}

myStocks_returns_monthly %>% 
  filter(symbol != "SPY") %>% # only display density of the stocks (not the ETF)
  ggplot(aes(x = monthly_returns, fill = symbol)) + # add some color (fill) just for fun
  geom_density() + 
  facet_wrap(~symbol) + # create a density plot for each stock
  labs(title = "Distribution of monthly returns per stock", 
       x = "monthly returns") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") # show no legend

```
We can see that deviation from 0.0 is strongest for Blackrock (BLK). Hence, the stock is highly volatile and thus the riskiest.
Opposed to this, the stock of Coca Cola (KO) is quite steady, with only small changes in monthly return. Hence, this stock
is the least risky.

However, it is not only about risk, but also about returns. Hence, let's plot the risk/return profiles of our stocks!

```{r risk_return_plot}

myStocks_returns_monthly_summary %>% 
  filter(symbol != "SPY") %>% # only display the stocks (not the ETF)
  ggplot(aes(x=sd, y = mean, label = symbol)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = symbol), size = 4) + # make points a little bigger
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE, group = 0) + # add a risk-return line
  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(aes(colour = symbol)) + # add the stock names as labels to the points
  labs(title = 'Risk/Return profile of stocks', 
       x = 'Risk (stdev of monthly returns)', 
       y ="Average monthly return") +
  theme_bw() + # use a nice theme
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + # display x values as percentages
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + # display y values as percentages
  theme(legend.position = "none") # show no legend

```

As a thumb of rule, taking a higher risk is rewarded with a higher average monthly return. 
We can see that even though FedEx (FDX) has the highest risk, it does not have the highest average monthly return.
Furthermore, Blackrock (BLK) has the highest average monthly return, with only a little more risk than American Express (AXP) and Oracle (ORCL).
Regarding our goal of making money with stocks, we would thus choose a combination of Blackrock and the lower risk McDonald's (MCD), as they are above our risk-return line.


# Efficient Frontier - Portfolio Optimization 

One thing that many people don't know about financial risk with stocks is that combining two or more stocks together doesn't just mean that we take the average of the risks of each stock to come up with the overall risk. No, actually it depends **A LOT** on how the two are correlated. If they move up or down together when the market changes, this is a bad sign. The less they are correlated, the more diverse of a risk portfolio you can build out of the stocks.  
*What do I mean by that?* the amazing result is that you can come up with a portfolio that has lower risk than any of the stocks it is made from *individually*. The possible combinations of the stocks is called the **Effective Frontier**.  

## Two Asset Frontier

Let's have a look at the effective frontier of first two of the stocks, I will be choosing BlackRock and Oracle. 
```{r, two asset effective frontier}
#pivot the dataframe so we can actually calculate covariances between the data
myStocks_returns_monthly_wider <- myStocks_returns_monthly %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = symbol, values_from=monthly_returns)

#if we ever want to exchange monthly data with annual data
#myStocks_returns_annual_wider <- myStocks_returns_annual %>% 
#  pivot_wider(names_from = symbol, values_from=yearly_returns)


#get Data for BlackRock and Oracle
df_BLK_ORCL <- myStocks_returns_monthly_wider %>% 
  select(date,BLK,ORCL) %>%  #select only the variables we need
  summarise(mean_BLK = mean(BLK), # calculate the means
            mean_ORCL= mean(ORCL),# calculate the means
            sd_BLK = sd(BLK), # calculate the standard deviation
            sd_ORCL = sd(ORCL), # calculate the standard deviation
            cov_BLK_ORCL = cov(ORCL,BLK)) # get the covariance between the stocks


#get the expected returns for both as a variable
exp_ret_BLK <- df_BLK_ORCL$mean_BLK
exp_ret_ORCL <- df_BLK_ORCL$mean_ORCL

#get the risk i.e. the standard deviation as a risk measure
risk_BLK <- df_BLK_ORCL$sd_BLK
risk_ORCL <- df_BLK_ORCL$sd_ORCL

#calculate the covariance between the two
cov_BLK_ORCL <- df_BLK_ORCL$cov_BLK_ORCL

#simulate the different weights you put into BLK
BLK_weights <- seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = 1000)

#create a data table for the weights 
effective_frontier_two_asset <- data.frame(w_BLK = BLK_weights,
w_ORCL = 1 - BLK_weights)

#use the formula:
#return_portfolio= weight_x*return_x + weight_y*return_y 
#for the returns

#and use the formula:
#std_portfolio = sqrt(sd_x^2*weight_x^2+sd_y^2*weight_y^2+ 2*weight_x*weight_y*cov_xy)
#for the risk of the 1000 portfolio scenarios

effective_frontier_two_asset <-effective_frontier_two_asset %>% 
  mutate(exp_ret_portfolio = w_BLK * exp_ret_BLK + w_ORCL * exp_ret_ORCL,
         sd_portfolio = sqrt(w_BLK^2 * risk_BLK^2 + w_ORCL^2 * 
                               risk_ORCL^2 + 2 * w_BLK * w_ORCL * cov_BLK_ORCL))

# #let's have a look at the data (in a nice html table format)
# effective_frontier_two_asset %>% 
#   kbl() %>%
#   kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")) # have a nice HTML table

#finally, let's plot the effective frontier!
effective_frontier_two_asset %>% 
ggplot()+
  geom_point(aes(x=sd_portfolio,y=exp_ret_portfolio,color=w_BLK))+ #plots all the combinations of BLK and ORCL
  labs(title = "Two assets combined can have a \nlower risk profile than each indvidually",
       subtitle = "Effective Frontier between BlackRock and Oracle",
       x = "Risk",
       y = "Expected Returns") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+ #add the percentage labels to the x-axis
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+  #add the percentage labels to the y-axis
  theme_bw()+
  NULL

```


Remarkable! Apparently, two stocks combined in a mixed weight portfolio can have a lower risk profile than either of the two individually! This reflects the fact that corellation between the two has an effect on the overall performance-risk trade-off. This seems to be a strong argument in favor of diversification.  

## Multi Asset Frontier


Now let's look not only at BlackRock and Oracle, but at a third Stock (FEDEX)!


```{r, Multi-Asset Effective Frontier}

#get Data for BlackRock and Oracle
df_BLK_ORCL_FDX <- myStocks_returns_monthly_wider %>% 
  select(date,BLK,ORCL,FDX) %>% #select the three stocks and the date
  summarise(mean_BLK = mean(BLK), #calculating mean of BLK
            mean_ORCL= mean(ORCL),#calculating mean of ORCL
            mean_FDX = mean(FDX),#calculating mean of FDX
            sd_BLK = sd(BLK),#calculating standard deviation of BLK
            sd_ORCL = sd(ORCL), #calculating standard deviation of ORCL
            sd_FDX = sd(FDX),#calculating standard deviation of FDX
            cov_BLK_ORCL = cov(ORCL,BLK), #covariance between ORCL and BLK
            cov_BLK_FDX = cov(BLK,FDX),#covariance between BLK and FDX
            cov_ORCL_FDX = cov(ORCL,FDX)) #covariance between ORCL and FDX
            


#get the expected returns for both as a variable
exp_ret_BLK <- df_BLK_ORCL_FDX$mean_BLK
exp_ret_ORCL <- df_BLK_ORCL_FDX$mean_ORCL
exp_ret_FDX <- df_BLK_ORCL_FDX$mean_FDX

#get the risk i.e. the standard deviation as a risk measure
risk_BLK <- df_BLK_ORCL_FDX$sd_BLK
risk_ORCL <- df_BLK_ORCL_FDX$sd_ORCL
risk_FDX <- df_BLK_ORCL_FDX$sd_FDX

#calculate the covariance between the two
cov_BLK_ORCL <- df_BLK_ORCL_FDX$cov_BLK_ORCL
cov_BLK_FDX <- df_BLK_ORCL_FDX$cov_BLK_FDX
cov_ORCL_FDX <- df_BLK_ORCL_FDX$cov_ORCL_FDX

#simulate the different weights you put into BLK
BLK_weights <- seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = 1000)
#BLK_weights

#create a data table for the weights 
#for every weight of BLK, we create 1000 combinations for the weight of ORCL
effective_frontier_three_asset <- data.frame(w_BLK = rep(BLK_weights,each=length(BLK_weights)),
w_ORCL = rep(BLK_weights,length(BLK_weights)))

effective_frontier_three_asset<- effective_frontier_three_asset %>% 
  mutate(w_FDX = 1-w_BLK-w_ORCL) #the weight for FDX is than 1 minus the other two

#let's have a look to see if we did it right
#effective_frontier_three_asset


#calculate the risk and return for every portfolio
effective_frontier_three_asset <-effective_frontier_three_asset %>% 
  mutate(exp_ret_portfolio = w_BLK * exp_ret_BLK + w_ORCL * exp_ret_ORCL+ w_FDX*exp_ret_FDX,
         sd_portfolio = sqrt(w_BLK^2 * risk_BLK^2 + w_ORCL^2 * risk_ORCL^2 + w_FDX^2*risk_FDX^2 +2 * w_BLK * w_ORCL * cov_BLK_ORCL+ 2 * w_BLK * w_FDX * cov_BLK_FDX+ 2 * w_ORCL * w_FDX * cov_ORCL_FDX))

#we have to constraint the choices to positive values (since we assume that short selling is fobidden/not possible)

effective_frontier_three_asset<- effective_frontier_three_asset %>% 
  filter(w_BLK >=0&w_ORCL>=0&w_FDX>=0)

#let's have a look at the data
#effective_frontier_three_asset 


#finally, let's plot the effective frontier!
effective_frontier_three_asset %>% 
ggplot()+
  geom_point(aes(x=sd_portfolio,y=exp_ret_portfolio,color = w_BLK-w_FDX))+
  labs(title = "Three assets combined create a 3D Region of possible portfolios",
       subtitle = "Effective Frontier between BlackRock,Oracle and Fedex",
       x = "Risk",
       y = "Expected Returns") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+ #put x-axis label in percentage
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+ #put y-axis label in percentage
  theme_bw()+
  scale_color_gradientn(colors = c("blue", "#800080", "red"), #change the color code
  name = expression(omega[BLK] - omega[FDX]), labels = scales::percent)+ #give the legend nicer labels
  NULL


```


# Analysis and Conclusion 

we see that our frontier has now become a region! This is due to the fact that 3 stocks create a 3-dimensional space for portfolio combinations.  
The Color code tells us basically that the red corner is where we invest everything in BLK, the blue one is everything in Fedex and the lila corner is everything in ORCL. 
While all points are theoretically possible, only the points on the border line of the region makes sense!  
*Why?* because the points inside the region are always worse than the points on the border!
